Summary: ## Summary: 

Today was a busy day filled with little moments. I had a funny interaction with someone who was wearing a pro-LGBTQ+ shirt.  Given we are in North Carolina, I told her how brave she was for wearing it, assuming she was local. Turns out, she was from California! We had a nice chat about how her home state is much more liberal.  She even told me, "You should see my car," which made me laugh.  I also had to help Ivette find a form for Russell - it was on her desk. It was a  "YWCA Employee Handbook" acknowledgment form for Russell to sign.  Later on, I took a moment to appreciate the nice weather in Wilmington - sunny with a high of 64Â° -  with my dogs, Grape and Peach.  They are such good dogs! I'm a little worried about my health, though. I need to remember to talk to my doctor on Monday about my lab results, my high blood glucose levels even with the Farxiga, and the fact that my elbow injection didn't help.

Summary: 
Today was a bit of an adventure.  I had a busy shift at work, dealing with a lot of customers and sorting out minor issues.  Later, I had to go into the San Francisco office to pick something up.  On the way back, we had a flat tire and had to deal with a police officer who was responding to a building alarm.  We ended up having to get the car towed and all four tires replaced.  It was an expensive fix, but necessary.  I also realized that we need to do our taxes â they're due in April. I'm going to try to do them myself this year.

## Atmosphere

The day was a mix of busy and stressful, with a bit of humor sprinkled in.

## Key Takeaways

* I need to call the Benefits Support Center for Walgreens on Monday. The number is 855-564-6153.
*  Our investment account is much lower because we cut it in half.
* I need to have a serious conversation with Yvette about yelling.  We may need to consider couples counseling.

Summary: ## Therapy Session Summary - February 8th 

Today's session focused on my son, Russell, and the challenges he's facing. He's a good kid, but struggles with social interaction and has been feeling lonely and unsure of himself.  We talked about how he recently overdosed on marijuana, which was a major reason why we moved from California to Wilmington in the first place. I'm worried about him, especially since he's graduating next January and I want him to feel prepared for the future. 

We discussed his recent interest in religion and how he's found some solace in Catholicism and Young Life, a Christian youth group.  While I don't share his beliefs, I'm glad he's found something positive.  He's also been working out regularly, which is great, although he did experiment with steroids for a while. Thankfully, he's stopped using them. 

We also talked about my own struggles with anxiety and how my father's parenting has influenced my own self-criticism.  We agreed to focus more on anxiety management techniques in our upcoming sessions.

The session felt productive and supportive. I appreciated the opportunity to discuss my concerns about Russell and explore potential solutions.  I'm grateful for the therapist's insights and guidance.
