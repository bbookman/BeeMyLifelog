He's a good kid, but struggles with social interaction and has been feeling lonely and unsure of himself.  We talked about how he recently overdosed on marijuana, which was a major reason why we moved from California to Wilmington in the first place. I'm worried about him, especially since he's graduating next January and I want him to feel prepared for the future. \n\nWe discussed his recent interest in religion and how he's found some solace in Catholicism and Young Life, a Christian youth group.  While I don't share his beliefs, I'm glad he's found something positive.  He's also been working out regularly, which is great, although he did experiment with steroids for a while. Thankfully, he's stopped using them. \n\nWe also talked about my own struggles with anxiety and how my father's parenting has influenced my own self-criticism.  We agreed to focus more on anxiety management techniques in our upcoming sessions.\n\n## Atmosphere\n\nThe session felt productive and supportive. I appreciated the opportunity to discuss my concerns about Russell and explore potential solutions.  I'm grateful for the therapist's insights and guidance.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n* **Psychiatrist Appointment:** I'm going to make an appointment for Russell with Dr. Scott Crowder, a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\n* **Therapy:** I'll also contact Holly Anne Barr, a psychotherapist, to see if she's a good fit for Russell.\n* **Anxiety Management:** I'm going to focus on managing my own anxiety so I can be a better support system for Russell. \n* **Open Communication:**  I'll continue to encourage Russell to communicate openly and honestly with me about his feelings and experiences. \n",
